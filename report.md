# brief

Concerning git and github I learned the difference between the two and how to make use of them to make teamwork easier and also keeping track of changes made to your project. I then learned how to use HTML to create websites/web apps. Additionally, I got to see how you can incorporate CSS and Java Script to advance your website and make it more enhancing for the user.
